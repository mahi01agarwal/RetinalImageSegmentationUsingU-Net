# RetinalImageSegmentationUsingU-Net

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks, specifically applied to the DRIVE dataset for vessel extraction from retinal images.
Based on the extracted content, here's a comprehensive README for the provided notebook:

## Introduction
U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture developed for biomedical image segmentation. The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

This notebook demonstrates the application of the U-Net model for the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images, which is a crucial step in diagnosing various retinal diseases.

## Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the DRIVE dataset (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction), which contains retinal images along with their corresponding segmentation masks.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (recommended)
- Kaggle API credentials (for dataset download)

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Dice coefficient. The results are visualized using segmentation masks overlaid on the original images.
